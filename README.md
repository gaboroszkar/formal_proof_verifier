# Formal proof validator

Formal logic proof verifier.

## TODO

* Documentation on how to use it, with examples.
* Docstring for functions, even to implementation functions.
* 100 % code coverage with tests.
* Use `elif`s in rules, not just simple `if`s with `return`.
* Better error messages, with more information.
* Do not use exceptions, but return with the error.
